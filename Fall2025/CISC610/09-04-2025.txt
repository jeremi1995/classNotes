Loop invariants:

- At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the sub array A[0...j-1]
consists of elements originally in A[0...j-1] but in sorted order

Running time = function of input size

RAM model:
- instructions execute sequentially, no parallelism
- one instruction costs the same as another
